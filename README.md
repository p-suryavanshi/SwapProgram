# Swap Program

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates multiple methods of swapping two variables in programming, showcasing both conventional and innovative approaches.

## Features
- Multiple swap methods including:
  - Traditional temporary variable
  - Arithmetic operations
  - Bitwise XOR
  - Tuple unpacking (in Python)
  - Utilizing data structures

## Prerequisites
- Basic understanding of programming concepts
- Relevant programming language environments installed (e.g., Python, C++, etc.)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/p-suryavanshi/SwapProgram.git
   cd SwapProgram
   ```

2. Install necessary packages (if applicable):
   ```bash
   # Specific installation instructions based on the required libraries
   ```

## Usage
- Open the source code file corresponding to your desired programming language.
- Follow the instructions or the comments in the code to run the swap demonstrations.

## Code Explanation
- The main function demonstrates how each method works step by step.
- Inline comments explain key lines and logic used in each swapping method.

## Different Swap Methods
1. **Temporary Variable**: Uses an intermediate variable to hold one value during the swap.
2. **Arithmetic Operations**: Swaps values without additional memory (potentially leading to overflow).
3. **Bitwise XOR**: A clever bit manipulation approach to swap values without using extra storage.
4. **Tuple Unpacking**: Python's elegant way to swap variables directly in a single line.
5. **Using Data Structures**: Learning how data structures (like lists) can be used for swapping.

## Conclusion
This repository aims to teach common techniques for swapping values in different programming environments, fostering understanding of memory management and variable handling.
